# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about), an annual coding challenge held during December! This repository contains my daily solutions implemented in Java.

## ðŸŒŸ About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a series of daily programming puzzles released each day from December 1st to December 25th. The puzzles are fun, challenging, and designed for developers of all levels. Learn more about it [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

Each day's puzzles are solved in their own package under `src/main/java/com/adventofcode/dayXX`. Here's the basic structure of the repository:
